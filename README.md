A Electrical Engineering Master's student at University of Stuttgart, majoring in Smart Systems (Machine Learning, Automation Systems and Intelligent Sensors).
Ihave experience working as Research Assistant in ILH and am working on Micro-controller communication, DSpace and MATLAB/Simulink.
I have also previously worked as a Associate Software Engineer and am well versed with C, python, and SQL. 
I'm always eager to try new things and put what I've learned into practice, which has lead me to create numerous models(Using Mc and IOT) in my spare time.
What you can expect from me is that I am passionate about my job, that I understand the client's needs, and that I deliver on time and with high quality.
